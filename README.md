This is a patient data storage and management system.

We had created a database in which Patient Medical History Will be stored
Patient can view their medical history by log-in into thier account.
Also Doctor can view and add/update patient medical history by loging in 
doctor section.


Patient Section:-
******************************************************************************************************
Patient can log-in to his/her account by entering their mobile number.
If patient is accesing the database first time he/she have to fill the *****sign-up form first***.

After Signing-in Patient have re-enter his/her mobile number to access their DashBoard which includes general information.
General information including name, blood broup, age etc. will be shown.

Along with this their is option of Medical History where patient can view their medical history
which includes date, treatment, status, consulted by and most important i.e prescription.

This will help patient to not to worry to carry the past prescription every time.
also it will give mobility to patient while in medical stores or going to different city for
medical emergency.

********************************************************************************************************

Doctor's Section:-
********************************************************************************************************
